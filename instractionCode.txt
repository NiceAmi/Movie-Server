Server Setup:

The server runs on http://localhost:5000.
MongoDB is used as the database, containing a movies database with users and movies collections.
User Authentication:

Users can register and login to the system.
Upon login, users receive a token valid for three hours, allowing them to perform actions.
Passwords are encrypted for security.
User CRUD Operations:

Users can perform CRUD operations on their own profiles.
Movie Operations:

Users can upload, view, update, and delete movies.
Full CRUD operations are available for managing movies.
Session Management:

A counter tracks each user's actions, limited to ten per day.
Actions are logged to a JSON file, organized by date, with details including user ID, action type, action count, and timestamp.
Project Execution:

The project is started with node ./main.js, not npm start, to ensure the counter functionality works correctly.
